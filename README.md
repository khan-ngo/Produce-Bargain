# UseCaseDB

This project uses MariaDB as the datasource of choice. 
README_INFO/UserCaseDB_inserts.sql will create the database, tables, and poulate with sample data to get you started.

My Java-EE applicaiton uses Java Persistence API (JPA) interface in conjunction with EclipseLink for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and to manage my relational data so that I can map, store, update and retrieve data from relational databases (MariaDB) to and from my Java objects. 

Database connection configurations can be found and updated within Java resources META-INF/persistence.xml
